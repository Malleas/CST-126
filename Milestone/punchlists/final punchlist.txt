Bugs
1.  When creating a new user, if all fields are blank, only password check error msg is present on error page.
    fix.  Moved password check to last in the list and removed all the exits from the other logic checks for required fields.
2.  btn on admin page for add user wasn't routing to userRegistrationPage.html
    fix.  Updated the header location to the correct file.
3.  When a non registered user logs in, they receive a blank page, update to error.
    fix.  added an else if to the end of the $rowcount for to see if user name exists and password matches.
4.  No requirements for log out option
    fix.  Add new btn under admin/new for log out, should destroy the session and redirect back to login.html.
