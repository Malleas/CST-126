Post Work Cleanup:
create Database.php to house repeatable connection string to azure DB
connect DB local connection to azure
update createPosts, createUsers, getContent and loginHandler to use new dbConnect() function
update the sytling to match blog page for login.html and userRegistrationPage.html.
remove loginFailed.php, it is unused.
remove homePage.html it is unused.

New Features:
Create getPosts() function, update getContent.php and new admin.php to use it.

Update getPosts() to only display posts that have been accepted (1).

Create getUnapprovedPosts().  Need this to query the DB for any posts that have an approved code of 0.

Post Mgmt. create a page that displays all current posts that are both accepted == false and denied == null.
each post should have an accept and denied btn.

Update posts DB to include two new fields for accepted or denied posts, accepted defaults to false, denied is blank

Admin console should have reject and accept buttons.

reject - update field for post for denied row to true

accept - update row to true and update denied to false.

update getContent to check for the flag to be true to display posts.

Bugs:
Update login screen header.  Currently says User Registration, update to User Login.

When logging in for the first time you were created with a "there are not posts to display" msg.  This was not ideal as
it required you to navigate manually to createPost.html to have the blog actually display a new post.  updated
getContent.php to redirect to createPost.html if there was nothing in the DB to display for the blog.  This should only
happen if a new DB is build for the posts or it gets deleted.  after first post is made it will always display on the
blog posts.

New clean up
Popular posts is looping but creating a new Popular post heading each time.  I'd like the posts to stay current in there
without a heading for each one.
