Create new Admin Panel.(add to admin btn page?  add a new column to the form?)
1.  should only be viewable by admin level
2.  Admin should be able to approve or delete users.  Deleting users needs to update users table userDeleted to "Y"
3.  Admin can ban users.  Update users table for userBanned to "Y".  User can still view posts but has removed ability
to post (or comment...may be added later).
4.  Add new pages for the admin panel for searchUsers.
5.  Add new pages for the admin panel for updateUser.
6.  Add new pages for the admin panel for deleteUser.
7.  Add new pages for the admin panel for addUser.  This should redirect back to userRegistrationPage.html.
8.  Update getAllUsers() to only bring back users that have the flag for userDelete = 'n'
9.  Add functionality to check role name and only display admin button on getContent.php if role = admin
10.  Add a button to the admin pannel to go back to blog home (getContent.php).
11.  Add additional if clause to button viewing to only display "New" if role = blogger.  All buttons should be hidden
if not one of the two roles.


Bugs / improvements:
1.  Update the user registration form to mark required fields with * instead of the non required
2.  Update requirements for password, ensure something that states what is required for password creation.
