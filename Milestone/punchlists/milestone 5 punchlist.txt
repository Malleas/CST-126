Need to define roles
1.  Admin - super user, should be able to approve, deny posts as well as any and all post manipulation needed (CRUD).
2.  Blogger - create posts, update their own post.  Reply to posts


Bugs / improvements:
1.  Update the user registration form to mark required fields with * instead of the non required
2.  Update requirements for password, ensure something that states what is required for password creation.
