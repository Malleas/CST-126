2.  Display current user qty
3.  Posts per day / month
4.  DB Data stored size.

Bug fixes / improvements
1.  Update admin.php.  When approving or denying with multiple posts, it would deny or approve all.  Solved this by
adding a input hidden to capture the ID on the post action.  Also learned to wrap each form input as needed.
2.  Update getContent.php with the same issue as the admin page.  update or deleting posts was affeting them all.  Needed
to pull the logic up and have a <form> wrap each button action.  updated to capture the ID as well.  This way when calling
updatePost.php the id was already in a $_POST variable that i could reuse.
