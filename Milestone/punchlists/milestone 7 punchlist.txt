Bugs/Refactors
1.  The admin panel buttons should not show their own button on their page, remove said buttons.
2.  With the addition of pushing the user name to createPosts, need to update it to just a php file and drop the html only file.
3.  Move the repeatable functions our from createPost.php to utils for checkProhibitedWords and createPost
